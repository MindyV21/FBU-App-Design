## Overview
### Description
Allows people to scan their handwritten documents with their phone cameras and convert them into easily searchable PDFs. The uploaded documents can then be annotated and organized with a table of contents.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** Mobile devices are convenient and allow for easy scanning of documents with the camera. 
- **Story:** Creates a convenient resource of handwritten documents, such as notes for a student. Allows students who prefer handwritten notes to more easily sift through a large amount of unorganized and unsearchable documents.
- **Market:** Any student or individual that handwrites often could utilize this app.
- **Habit:** Students are likely to use this each day, after the end of each notetaking session. Students would also use this app to study and annotate their uploaded notes.
- **Scope:** V1 would only scan documents using the camera and convert them into searchable documents. V2 would include a tagging system to organize documents. V3 would incorporate annotative features like a highlighter, setting breakpoints and/or a pen tool. V4 would let the user calibrate their handwriting to gain a more accurate scan for future scans.
